# FMCG_Analysis
## üß† 1. Business Context
- This project simulates the business operations of Nestl√© Poland from 2022 to 2024, focusing on several popular food product lines.
- Nestl√© Poland is one of the leading companies in the consumer packaged goods (CPG) industry in Poland, operating in a highly competitive market with rapidly shifting consumer behavior.
- In this dynamic environment, Nestl√© faces challenges in understanding how factors such as pricing, promotions, delivery times, and regional demand affect business performance. A lack of clear insight into these dynamics can result in missed opportunities for growth and inefficiencies in operations.
- Thus, this data analysis project aims to help identify key business drivers that influence revenue growth and operational performance, enabling Nestl√© to make more informed, data-driven decisions and align strategy with market trends.

## üéØ 2. Key Business Questions
To support relevant business units such as the Sales & Marketing Department, Demand Planning Team, and Regional Distribution Managers in making data-informed decisions, this project seeks to address the following key business questions:

**Sales & Channel Performance**
- Which sales channels are generating the highest revenue and growth?
- How do sales differ across product categories, pack types, and regions?
- Are there underperforming SKUs or regions that require intervention?

**Promotion Effectiveness**
- To what extent do promotions impact units sold across different products or channels?
- Which types of promotions are most effective in driving sales uplift?
- Are promotional products cannibalizing regular sales or encouraging upsell?

**Pricing Strategy**
- What is the relationship between unit price and quantity sold?
- Are certain product segments more sensitive to price changes?
- Does pricing vary significantly across regions or sales channels?

**Inventory & Delivery Optimization**
- Are there consistent delays in delivery across certain regions or product types?
- How does delivery time impact sales performance?
- Are there recurring patterns in stockouts or overstock situations?

**Demand Trends & Seasonality**
- Are there clear seasonal trends in product demand across months or quarters?
- How have customer purchase patterns shifted over time?
- Can we detect early signals of changing market demand?

## 4. Data Preprocessing
**Datatype Standardization**
- Converted `date` column from object to `datetime` format to enable time-based operations and aggregations.

**Feature Engineering**
- Calendar & Seasonality
  - Extracted year, month, and week from the date column.
  - Created a `is_holiday_peak` column indicating whether the date is a public holiday.
  - Created a `is_holiday_week` column marking whether the week contains at least one holiday ‚Äî based on the insight that customer demand may increase in the days leading up to a holiday.
  - Added seasonal flags:
    - `is_summer`: marks weeks during summer months.
    - `is_winter`: marks weeks during winter months.

- Product Lifecycle
  - Computed `sku_age` for each SKU to track how long each product has been on the market.
  - Defined a `lifecycle_stage` column based on product age and sales:
    - *Introduction*: SKU age ‚â§ 12 weeks.
    - *Growth*: SKU age from 13 to 30 weeks.
    - *Maturity*: SKU age from 31 to 60 weeks.
    - For SKUs older than 60 weeks:
      - If rolling_sales ‚â• median: still considered *Maturity*.
      - If rolling_sales < median: classified as *Decline*.
