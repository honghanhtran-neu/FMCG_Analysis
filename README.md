# FMCG_Analysis
## üß† Business Context
- This project simulates the business operations of Nestl√© Poland from 2022 to 2024, focusing on several popular food product lines.
- Nestl√© Poland is one of the leading companies in the consumer packaged goods (CPG) industry in Poland, operating in a highly competitive market with rapidly shifting consumer behavior.
- In this dynamic environment, Nestl√© faces challenges in understanding how factors such as pricing, promotions, delivery times, and regional demand affect business performance. A lack of clear insight into these dynamics can result in missed opportunities for growth and inefficiencies in operations.
- Thus, this data analysis project aims to help identify key business drivers that influence revenue growth and operational performance, enabling Nestl√© to make more informed, data-driven decisions and align strategy with market trends.
