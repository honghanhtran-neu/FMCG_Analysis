# FMCG_Analysis
## 🧠 1. Business Context
- This project simulates the business operations of Nestlé Poland from 2022 to 2024, focusing on several popular food product lines.
- Nestlé Poland is one of the leading companies in the consumer packaged goods (CPG) industry in Poland, operating in a highly competitive market with rapidly shifting consumer behavior.
- In this dynamic environment, Nestlé faces challenges in understanding how factors such as pricing, promotions, delivery times, and regional demand affect business performance. A lack of clear insight into these dynamics can result in missed opportunities for growth and inefficiencies in operations.
- Thus, this data analysis project aims to help identify key business drivers that influence revenue growth and operational performance, enabling Nestlé to make more informed, data-driven decisions and align strategy with market trends.
