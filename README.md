# FMCG_Analysis
## Business Context
This project simulates the business operations of Nestlé Poland from 2022 to 2024, focusing on several popular food product lines.
Nestlé Poland is one of the leading companies in the consumer packaged goods (CPG) industry in Poland, operating in a highly competitive market with rapidly shifting consumer behavior. In this dynamic environment, Nestlé faces challenges in understanding how factors such as pricing, promotions, delivery times, and regional demand affect business performance. A lack of clear insight into these dynamics can result in missed opportunities for growth and inefficiencies in operations.
Thus, this data analysis project aims to help identify key business drivers that influence revenue growth and operational performance, enabling Nestlé to make more informed, data-driven decisions and align strategy with market trends.
